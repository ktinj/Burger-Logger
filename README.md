# Burger-Logger

### Description

A burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### Installation

1. Make a package.json file by running `npm init` from the command line.

2. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express`.

3. Install the Handlebars npm package: `npm install express-handlebars`.
